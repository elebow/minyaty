--replace option

config file should not require pattern for all, uncategorized

alternate window command (like my old alt+esc)
	also use this to decide which window to raise when the current window is closed

non-WM mode, where minyaty is just a switcher

new windows can steal focus only if child of current window
	or share a non-root parent with current window?
	configurable

unmap event â†’ circulate up?

commands to show, hide, and toggle taskbar visibility

Unhandled exception: Missing hash key: "patterns" (KeyError)
	config file category without pattern

taskbar click on currently-focused window circulates it up
	or other, configurable behavior

taskbar visual distinction for active window
	and alternate window?

taskbar click on category name cycles through
	or anywhere in a category's region that is not a window item

Prefix output with program name so it can be easily extracted from xsession-errors file

set last category, etc when switching via taskbar click
	move that logic out of command.cr to Window#raise ?

deb package

"all" and "uncategorized" categories should always exist, even if not configured
	presence in config file only controls whether they appear in taskbar
	when no categories are defined, "uncategorized" is equal to "all". This is fine.
