# Minyaty

Minyaty is an X11 window manager that emphasizes low-effort switching between full-screen windows.

Rather than a stacking or tiling model, Minyaty uses a switching model: It sizes all windows to cover the entire screen and provides powerful tools to quickly raise the window you want.

When configured appropriately, a given window can be raised with a short, deterministic series of keystrokes. For example, in my configuration, `alt + F1` raises the terminal, `alt + F2` raises the primary browser, and `alt + F2, F2` raises the secondary browser. `alt + tab` alternates between the current and previous windows, and `alt + esc` cycles backwards through window history. See below for configuration and command documentation.

Minyaty was designed for use with a single monitorâ€”I have come to prefer a single monitor with a powerful window switcher over multiple monitors. Multiple monitors may be supported in the future.

Minyaty can be thought of as a tagged alt-tabber, and in the future may support a non-window-manager mode wherein it offers only window switching.
